3. Overide config with env
e.q. SERVER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8081 make server -> run server on port 8081

4. Generate mock for db.Store interface
$ mockgen -destination db/mock/store.go github.com/edwillam1007/simplebank/db/sqlc Store

5. Create migration schema
$ migrate create -ext sql -dir db/migration -seq add_users

6. Build docker file
$ docker build -t simplebank:latest .

7. Run container
$ docker run --name simplebank -p 8080:8080 simplebank:latest

8. Run container with GIN in default mode
$ docker run --name simplebank -p 8080:8080 -e GIN_MODE=release simplebank:latest

9. Run container with assing postgres address
$ docker run --name simplebank -p 8080:8080 -e GIN_MODE=release -e DB_SOURCE="postgresql://root:secret@192.168.1.2:5432/simple_bank?sslmode=disable" simplebank:latest

10. Create our own network
$ docker network create bank-network
    10.1 link container to our network
    $ docker network connect bank-network postgres12
    10.2 using container name to connect postgres
    $ docker run --name simplebank --network bank-network -p 8080:8080 -e GIN_MODE=release -e DB_SOURCE="postgresql://root:secret@postgres12:5432/simple_bank?sslmode=disable" simplebank:latest

11. start docker compose
$ docker-compose up

12. stop docker compose
$ docker-compose down
